perhaps the most noticeable change from tekken 2 fight system is movement reform  whereas the element of depth had been largely insignificant in previous tekken games aside from some characters having unique sidesteps and dodging maneuvers tekken 3 added emphasis on the third axis allowing all characters to sidestep in or out of the background by lightly pressing the arcade stick or tapping the controller button in the console version towards the corresponding direction another big change in movement was that jumping was toned down no longer allowing fighters to jump to extreme heights as was present in previous games but keeping leaps to reasonable realistic heights it made air combat more controllable and put more use to sidestep dodges as jumping no longer became a universal dodge move that was flying above all of the ground moves other than that the improved engine allowed for quick recoveries from knockdowns more escapes from tackles and stuns better juggling as many old moves had changed parameters allowing them to connect in combosituations where they wouldnt connect in previous games and extra newly created combo throws
tekken 3 was the first tekken to feature a beat em up minigame called tekken force which pitted the player in various stages against enemies in a sidescrolling fashion if the player succeeds in beating the minigame four times dr bosconovitch would be a playable character granted that you defeat him first this was continued in tekken 4 and succeeded by the devil within minigame in tekken 5  but boskonovitch was dropped as a playable character after tekken 3 there is also a minigame tekken ball similar to beach volleyball where one has to hit the ball with a powerful attack to hurt the opponent or try to hit the ball in such a way that it hits the ground in the opponents area thus causing damage",4200,13,253,183,2
